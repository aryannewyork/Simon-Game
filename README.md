# Simon Game

It is a simple remembering game, you can press any key on your keyboard to start.
Once the game starts, one of the four colors will flash on the screen and you have to remeber the pattern starting from the beginning.
In the LEVEL-0, you simply have to remember a pattern of one color that has flashed initially. Then after the color has flashed you have to click on the correct color that has flashed before. On correct guess you will be promoted to the next level. And another color will be flashed. Now this time you have to hit all the colors starting from the initial color in the correct order to move to next level. As it seems the game keeps getting a little harder on each level promotion.
